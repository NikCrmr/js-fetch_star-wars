/*
Have a look at the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) file: 
There is an `EXAMPLE_DATA` object with information about
 Luke Skywalker. We use this object to create a DOM element with the `Card()` function and append this element to the DOM with the help of `renderElement`.

This approach is very static and not very handy. Lets get more data and create new cards from them dynamically!

### Task 1: Fetch data from the Star Wars Api:

Fetch data from the star wars api (https://swapi.dev/api/people).

Use the `async` and `await` keywords to receive the response and request the data with the `.json() method`.
Use a `console.log()` to look at the received data!

### Task 2: Moooooooooore cards!

Use an array method to create and render a card for each object in the fetched data array.

The following hints may guide you:

- What was the array method again to perform an action **for each** element?
- You can use the functions `Card()` and `renderElement()` to create those cards, see the explanation above!

Please switch to the [`js/index.js`](./js/index.js) file to start counting!
